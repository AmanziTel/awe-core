Shows how to store and query a neo4j database

1. Download the database type: ./install.sh
2. Run the application: jruby find_actors.rb willis

The find_actors.rb uses migration which means that the first time the it is used it will take
a while to process the imdb file and create the index.

Notice that you can play around with migrations by require the 'find_actor' in JIRB and then for example
  Neo4j.migrate! 1
which will delete the lucene index (migration number 2)

Description of the version 2 of awe_afp.

1. This new version differs from the last one by a new user interface, called also control-file format.
The format is self-explained, see the example below. It is essential to use the new format.

2. All formats of files occurred in control-file are the same as in the version before: carriers.txt, neighbours.txt, interference.txt and carriers2.txt.

3. New in  this version is that: you can run this afp for separated cell-plan only, or site-plan only, with or without neigbours,
with or without second-order neighbours, with or without interference matrix. So plans for a networks without IT-matrix are now also possible.
In many tests we could observe, that sometimes they are not 'bad'. For this indication see the line "TrafficOrAreaInterference".
Here: 0 = no IT-matrix; 1= with IT-matrix by traffic interference, 2= by area interference.

The usage of neighbours will be indicated by the "DistanceSpacingConditionRequiredForNeigbours". If 0 then no neighbours will be used.
Similarly for second-order neighbours.

4. In this version the indicator "Quality" has much more influence on the plan. In the most real examples,
we can have plan with Quality 0 in a very fast (seconds-minutes) way. In the coming user guide, we will describe
more detailed why and how to use this Quality indicator

5. For using this tree examples Demo1, Demo2, Demo3 the user of course has to adapt all paths names occurred in the particular files, please.



Example:

FileWithAllCells "G:\AMANZI\V2\Demo1\carriers.txt"
DistanceSpacingConditionForSites 1
DistanceSpacingConditionForCells 1
MaximumRTDemandperCell 1
DistanceSpacingConditionRequiredForNeigbours 1
DistanceSpacingConditionForSecondOrderNeigbours 1
NeighboursConditionFile "G:\AMANZI\V2\Demo1\neighbours.txt"
TrafficOrAreaInterference 1                                      /// 0=No Interference Matrix; 1=Traffic-IT,2=Area-IT
IndicatorForSecondOrderNeigboursUsage 1                		 /// 0= do not use second order n.; 1= use son.
Quality 89                                              	 /// quality versus speed

/**
 * IApplication used by the uDig product - subclass for your own application.
 * <p>
 * The UDIGApplication serves three goals:
 * <ul>
 * <li>It is a show case of what the SDK can do; usable by end-users as a functional GIS
 * Application
 * <li>It is an example for other RCP developers to copy (either cut and paste or subclass)
 * <li>It provides static final helper methods that can be used by other RCP developers
 * </ul>
 * If you wanted to configure how the menus and toolbars are ordered please look into
 * overriding the UDIGWorkbenchAdvisor in addition to this class.

 * <h2>Rolling your Own</h2>
 * Your application will need to be registered with the
 * <code>org.eclipse.equinox.applications</code> extension-point.
